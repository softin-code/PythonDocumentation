### 2. 🧠 **Problem Solving Strategies**

Here are steps to follow when solving problems:

#### 🔢 Understand the Problem
- Read carefully
- Look at constraints and examples

#### ✍️ Break It Down
- Write a brute-force solution
- Look for patterns

#### 🔁 Optimize
- Reduce time/space complexity
- Use appropriate data structures

#### ✅ Test Cases
- Try custom inputs
- Edge cases: empty inputs, large inputs, duplicates

### 3. 📦 Additional DSA Topics for Problem Solving

| Data Structure | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **Stack**      | Valid Parentheses, Min Stack |
| **Queue**      | Implement Queue using Stacks |
| **HashMap**    | Two Sum, Group Anagrams |
| **Heap**       | Top K Frequent Elements |
| **Linked List**| Reverse Linked List |
| **Tree**       | Binary Tree Level Order |
| **Graph**      | BFS/DFS traversal, Word Ladder |
| **Sliding Window** | Max Subarray, Longest Substring |
| **Two Pointers** | 3Sum, Container With Most Water |

### 4. 💡 Dynamic Programming, Greedy & Backtracking

#### ✅ Dynamic Programming (DP)

📌 Characteristics:
- Optimal substructure
- Overlapping subproblems

```python
# Example: Fibonacci with DP
def fib(n):
    dp = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        dp.append(dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])
    return dp[n]

print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
```

---

#### ✅ Greedy Algorithm

📌 Idea: Pick best option at every step.

```python
# Example: Jump Game
def canJump(nums):
    reach = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if i > reach:
            return False
        reach = max(reach, i + num)
    return True

print(canJump([2,3,1,1,4]))  # Output: True
```

---

#### ✅ Backtracking

📌 Try all possibilities; backtrack if invalid.

```python
# Example: N-Queens (simplified)
def solveNQueens(n):
    res = []
    board = ["."*n for _ in range(n)]

    def is_valid(row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i][col] == "Q":
                return False
            if col - (row - i) >= 0 and board[i][col - (row - i)] == "Q":
                return False
            if col + (row - i) < n and board[i][col + (row - i)] == "Q":
                return False
        return True

    def backtrack(row):
        if row == n:
            res.append(board[:])
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if is_valid(row, col):
                board[row] = board[row][:col] + "Q" + board[row][col+1:]
                backtrack(row + 1)
                board[row] = board[row][:col] + "." + board[row][col+1:]

    backtrack(0)
    return res

print(solveNQueens(4))  # Output: Solutions for 4-Queens
```

def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if target - num in seen:
            return [seen[target - num], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
```
