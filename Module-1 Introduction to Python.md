## 🐍 **Introduction to the Course and Its Objectives**
**Goal**: Learn to write Python code for real-world problems and applications.

**You will learn to:**
- Write clean Python code
- Use Python data types and control structures
- Build reusable code with functions and modules
- Work with file systems, errors, and external libraries

---

## 💬 **Overview of Python as a Programming Language**

- High-level and beginner-friendly
- Interpreted, not compiled
- Used for web, data science, automation, AI, and more
- Popular tools: Jupyter, VS Code, PyCharm

---

## ⚙️ **Setting Up the Development Environment**

### ✅ 1. Install Python
- Download from: [https://python.org](https://python.org)
- Install Python and check:
```bash
python --version
```

### ✅ 2. Choose an IDE or Code Editor
- Beginner-friendly: **IDLE** (comes with Python)
- Recommended: **VS Code**, **PyCharm**, **Jupyter Notebooks**

### ✅ 3. Write and Run Code
- Use terminal: `python filename.py`
- Use interactive mode: `python`

---

## 👋 **Your First Python Program**

```python
# hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

✅ **Class Condition:** Submit a simple Hello World program.

## 🔤 **Basic Data Types and Variables**

Python has several built-in data types:

### 1. **String** – Text

```python
name = "Alice"
print(name)
```

### 2. **Integer** – Whole number

```python
age = 25
print(age)
```

### 3. **Float** – Decimal number

```python
price = 19.99
print(price)
```

### 4. **Boolean** – True/False

```python
is_student = True
print(is_student)
```

### 5. **Multiple Variables**

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b, c)
```

---

## 🧪 **Bonus Examples: Type Checking & Conversion**

### 🔹 `type()` function:

```python
x = "123"
print(type(x))  # <class 'str'>
```

### 🔹 Type conversion:

```python
x = "123"
y = int(x)
print(y + 1)  # 124
```

## 🧩 Mini Practice Task

Write a Python program that:
1. Declares a string variable for your name
2. Declares an integer for your age
3. Prints both in a sentence using `print()` and f-string

```python
name = "John"
age = 28
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```
